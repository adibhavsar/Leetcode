# [24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

Given alinked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem withoutmodifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/swap_ex1.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 222px;">

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in thelistis in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
